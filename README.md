## 🔒 Security Considerations

**Note**: This is a front-end demonstration application with mock authentication.

For production use, implement:
- Backend API for authentication
- Secure token-based auth (JWT)
- Password hashing
- HTTPS encryption
- Server-side session management

## 📝 Assumptions & Design Decisions

1. **Data Persistence**: Uses in-memory state (React state) for demo purposes
2. **Mock Data**: Predefined users and products for demonstration
3. **Session Management**: Uses React Context (would use secure cookies/tokens in production)
4. **Validation**: Client-side validation only (server-side needed for production)
5. **Low Stock Threshold**: Set at 100 units for demonstration
